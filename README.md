# GenesisDrive-Server
GenesisDrive, a confidential Web3 Storage application built on Web3.storage and NFT.storage. It supports traditional passphrase based client-side encryption and (Trusted Execution Environment) Intel SGX based key derivation.   With this, now users can store their encrypted data over IPFS and Filecoin without losing their privacy. If the user chose to go with Intel SGX based key derivation, then user need not to worry about maintaining passphrase locally.  Also, We planned to support NFT.storage IPFS link creation from the already stored contents in single-click.
